# Palmer Penguins Classification

## Goal

The goal of this project was to determine a small set of measurements that are highly predictive of a penguin's species.

## Data Set

The machine learning models were trained and evaluated on the [Palmer Penguins data set](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/), which was collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network. The CSV data contains measurements on three penguin species: Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adelie.

## Overview of Project

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Modeling
  - Logistic regression and cross validation were used for feature selection
  - Model 1: Multinomial Logistic Regression
  - Model 2: Decision Tree Classifier
